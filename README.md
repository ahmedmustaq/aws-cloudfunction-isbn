## Introduction

The AWS Cloud Function for ISBN project is designed to manage and process ISBN-related data using serverless architecture. This project leverages AWS Lambda, S3, SNS, and SES to provide a scalable and efficient solution for ISBN data handling.

## Features

- AWS Lambda functions for processing ISBN data.
- Integration with AWS S3 for storing and retrieving data files.
- Notifications using AWS SNS.
- Email notifications using AWS SES.

## Technologies Used

- Java
- AWS Lambda
- AWS S3
- AWS SNS
- AWS SES
- Maven

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Java 8 or higher
- Maven
- AWS CLI configured with your credentials
- Serverless Framework (`npm install -g serverless`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/ahmedmustaq/aws-cloudfunction-isbn.git
cd aws-cloudfunction-isbn
\`\`\`

2. Build the project using Maven:

\`\`\`bash
./mvnw clean install
\`\`\`

### Deploying the Application

Deploy the application using the Serverless Framework:

\`\`\`bash
serverless deploy
\`\`\`

The Serverless Framework will package and deploy your Lambda functions along with the necessary S3, SNS, and SES configurations.

## Configuration

The configuration files are located in the `src/main/resources` directory. Key configuration files include:

- `application.properties`: Main configuration file for the application.
- `serverless.yml`: Configuration for deploying the application using the Serverless Framework.
- `output-sam.yaml`: SAM template for AWS deployment (if using AWS SAM CLI).

## Usage

### Basic Usage

This project provides several Lambda functions for handling ISBN data. The Lambda function, `BookHandler`, is triggered by S3 events. It processes the incoming S3 objects, sends notifications via SNS, and sends emails using SES.

### Custom Data Models

The project includes comprehensive data models for ISBN data, located in the `src/main/java/com/maintainapps/schema/xml` directory. These models define the structure and validation rules for the data processed by the application.
